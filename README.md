# HADOOP and MAP REDUCE

Large and complex data, difficult to process them using traditional data processing applications as it is computationally difficult to reveal
patterns, trends, and associations, especially relating to human behavior and interactions. Apache Hadoop is an open-source software framework used for distributed storage and processing of dataset of big data using the MapReduce programming model.

1. [mrjob](https://github.com/Yelp/mrjob) is a Python library from [Yelp](https://www.yelp.com/sf) that wraps map-reduce and can run jobs on EMR.
2. [Luigi](https://github.com/spotify/luigi) is a Python library from [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/us/) that lets you write map-reduce workflows more easily.
3. [Cascading](www.cascading.org) is a layer on top of Hadoop that has further layers such as (Scalding)[https://github.com/twitter/scalding] ([Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/)) from [Twitter](https://twitter.com/) - yet another way to simplify working with map-reduce.
